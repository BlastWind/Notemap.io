figure out force layout
thoughts: to create force directed diagram, one needs the NODES and the LINKS
our NODES are the circles and links are links
links specifies indexes of the nodes array it is connecting

apparently, if I just do
simulation = d3.forceSimulation(this.circles).force("link", d3.forceLink().links(links))
it might work

on new link circles cx is returning
